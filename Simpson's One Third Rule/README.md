# Simpson's 1/3 Rule

Inputs:
* x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
* y = the vector of function values with respect to x

Outputs:
* I = the numerical integral calculated

This program will numerical evaluate the integral of the vector of function values y with respect to x. This program will also use the trapezoidal rule if needed for the last interval.

This program will error if the inputs are not the same length or if the x inputs are not equally spaced.
