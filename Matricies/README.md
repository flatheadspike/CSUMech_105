# SpecialMatrix

This program will take 2 input numbers and create a matrix using these numbers as a guideline. These inputs are "n" and "m" respectively. The "n" input is for the number of rows down the matrix with have. While the input "m" is for the number of columns right the matrix will have.

This program will error if not two inputs are provided.

From there the rest of the matrix will be filled in by following a rule. Startig on the matrix position (2,2) the number that will be put there will be the sum of the number above that position and the one to the left of that position. 

For example if you have a matrix that is a 4 x 5, the number in the (2,3) spot of the matrix will be 7 as the nuber above it is 3 and the number to the left of it is 4 from its own equation being 2+2.
