# Linear Regression

Inputs:
* x-values of the data set
* y-values of the data set

Outputs:
* Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* Slope from the linear regression (m in )
* Intercept from the linear regression (b in )
* Rsquared value

This program will first see if it needs to sort the input values and if it needs to remove an outlire from the data set. Which then it will complete the linear regression of the data set and calculate the Rsquared value for the regression.

This program will error if the x and y values do not have the same number of data points.
