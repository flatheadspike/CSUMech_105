# LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting

Inputs:
* A - coefficient matrix

Output:
* L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
* U - upper triangular matrix
* P - the pivot matrix

This program will determine the LU Factorization of a square matrix. The program uses partial pivoting to acomplish this.
